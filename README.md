# Print to PDF

A REST API to generate PDFs from Web pages.

Just make your HTML document available at a public URL, and generate a PDF out
of it adjusting options like paper or margins, without installing any paid
library or software.

Resulting PDFs are uploaded to an S3 bucket where they can be downloaded.

## As a Serverless application

You can deploy this repository as a serverless application using an AWS CloudFormation
Template to create an AWS API Gateway that invokes Lambda functions to serve requests.

## Development

_All the following instructions assume you have at least [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed._

**Start a simulated AWS API Gateway** (_provided you have AWS SAM Local and Docker installed_):
> `yarn run api-gateway`

**Validate CloudFormation template** (_provided you have AWS CLI installed_)
> `make validate`

**Package CloudFormation template** (_provided you have AWS CLI and Docker installed_)
> `make layers` (_this is needed only the first time, then when updating Puppeteer version_)
> `make package`

**Deploy CloudFormation template** (_provided you have AWS CLI and Docker installed_)
> `make deploy`
> `make deploy ENVIRONMENT=Production`
